You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. .anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

    "text": "Greetings .anand , and ! I just finished this course with good marks (I think) and wanted to thank you for this wonderful course and also some feedbacks as the course pattern was changed this term. The course content covers most tools and techniques needed in Data Science in just 9 weeks. The extremely hard ROE did push me beyond my limits and with the help of friendship , I managed to crack it. As for the Projects , they were pretty interesting and gave a good learning experience. I have completed all subjects in Diploma and I am experienced in programming so it went well for me. But students who are doing this subject early in their Diploma will find it pretty difficult especially Project 2 . So, one suggestion would be to add prerequisites for this subject and suggest them to take TDS in their last term. The End Term was easy but there was no point on adding a question to calculate a lengthy expression manually to calculate distance. It proves nothing except that I am good at mathematics. Special mentions to for those great live sessions. That really helped ! That as well. Thank you again. Amit.",

    "text": ".anand Dear Sir, I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh` which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the",

It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB.

    "text": "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type `code -s` , then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of `code -s` ? The output of `code -s` cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it. image 1214×831 34.8 KB",

Consider the table Col 1 Col 2 Row 1, Col1 Row 1 Col 2 Row 2, Col 1 Row 2 Col 2 Will this be something like this `\"|Col 1| Col 2|\\n|-|-|\\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\"` or something like `\"\\n\\n\\nCol 1\\nCol 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRow 1, Col1\\nRow 1 Col 2\\n\\n\\nRow 2, Col 1\\nRow 2 Col 2\\n\\n\\n \"` HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS In one question, there were two tasks. Find the answer to the question Enable the `disabled` text block In this question, what will the answer type be? Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block MORE THAN ONE FILE Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table. In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this `curl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=question text\" \\ -F \"file= Image file\" \\ -F \"file= table file/ string\"` CORS HEADERS Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?",

If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying.. I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2.

But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.` The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file.

In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal. lakshaygarg654: `InGA4 Q10, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment.

    "text": "Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday’s Session) Respected TDS Team, As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following ’s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation. Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue GA3 Q8 Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag. GA3 Q9 Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN. Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation? GA4 Q2 & Q10 Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved. Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems. Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.",

    "text": "Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file. Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters. The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists. The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually) To check if a string has invisible characters, `# Multi-line string my_string = \"\"\"Hello World with spaces and some newlines and a tab \"\"\" # Print ASCII values of each character print([ord(c) for c in my_string])` e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9 This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response, `import requests import json # This is just an example server to see what we see. url = \"https://httpbin.org/post\" my_multiline_string_answer = \"\"\"This is a multiline string that spans multiple lines with spaces and some newlines and a tab as well.\"\"\" response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = { \"answer\": my_multiline_string_answer } # Send the JSON data response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator) # Check the response print (response.status_code) print (response.json ()) print (response.text) # Do other checks as necessary...` See what happens when I print the result `print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])` Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 1.09.56 pm 323×120 3.61 KB Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA. Here is a json example: `json_answer = { \"mary\": \"poppins\", \"age\": 42 } stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer) response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = { \"answer\": stringed_json } response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator) print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])` Look at the response.

The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

    "text": ".anand Final Thoughts on Project 2 Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions. Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed. Thank you for the learning opportunity",

When calling the API, should we pass the `.gz` file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the `.gz` file? Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows? Essentialy, will the API call look like so? `curl -X POST “http://127.0.0.1:5000”-H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data”-F \"question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents -anand.netis a personal website that had region-specific music content.

    "text": "Hello Sir, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using `vicky_server.py` , which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. `My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.` However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem? Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes `first.py` for GA1. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project! Best regards, vicky kumar .anand my model at Vicky kumar tds",

Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use `gpt-4o-mini` as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note : This uses a dummy `httpx` library, not the real one. You can only use: `response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)` `response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)` `response.raise_for_status()` `response.json()` `[quote=\"22f3000819, post:173, topic:169029\"] The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions.

    "text": "What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription. For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer. So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation. Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question? Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster. Regards, Shivaditya",

Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our",

Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections All in all I am happy with the course.",

    "text": "Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: `What is this going on? Is it joking?` I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: `Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?` We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: `I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.` Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: `They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?` Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: `And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?` I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: `It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.` Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: `Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?` Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail",

If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: `They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.` This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: `Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.` If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree",

Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: `They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.` Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: `Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"` That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: `I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?` They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: `The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.` If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: `In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for",

Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.` Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: `It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.` I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve. Kind regards, TDS team",

    "text": "Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): `The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.` Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic `What does this RoE evaluate?Implicit learning.` I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn` . Then I",

In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn` . Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to .anand , , and `Just two suggestions` I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites. While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.",

While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.

    "text": ": From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website : https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras , we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API . The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot , accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API , processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code , and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents —they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure ? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files , or queried in non-standard formats like “code -s” or “code -v”. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py` Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)` Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras . It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: `code -s` / `code -v` → VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string → Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever `/api` endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend ( `vicky_server.py` ) and web frontend ( `vicky_app.py` ) I want to extend a huge",

For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs. We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.

I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307 whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/” The logs from Cloud Run image 982×552 133 KB As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below). image 831×645 41.7 KB I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job.

When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok’s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding. New project 2 url:- https://96c8-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/",

However, my server is still actively running on Vercel https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app and the correct API endpoint is: correct api : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/ Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately 50 to 60 seconds to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both Podman and Linux environments. Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well. If possible, I kindly request either of the following: Re-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or Re-evaluation using the Render link , with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time. Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed. Thank you for your support and guidance.",

I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end. I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks. For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment. I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in. I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation. Thank you very much for your time and understanding. api link : https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/ git 949×580 62.4 KB",

    "text": "* Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint Dear I hope you’re doing well! I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at: `https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/` However, I’m encountering the following error: `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app` After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) . This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS : `8.8.8.8` , `8.8.4.4` Cloudflare DNS : `1.1.1.1` , `1.0.0.1` This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration. Alternate Option: If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead: `https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/` Please note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs. Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results. Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

    "text": "Hi Jivraj, I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge. I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently. Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address. Thank you! 1000063856 1920×858 139 KB",

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’” } What Was Expected: The question required developing a script that: Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure. It was explicitly stated that: Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values. The file to be used was: E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json What I Did: I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure. Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\ -H “accept: application/json” \\ -F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \\ -F “file=:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json” API Output:{“answer”:“14602”} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’” However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.",

Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully. Project-2 Evaluation Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage. Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks. In anticipation of quick response Thank You",

I’m Vicky Kumar , a student from the Data Science and Applications program at IIT Madras . Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called “Vicky App” — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS, . The system is capable of: Accurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech What’s in it for students: They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload I’ve made it free for the first 3 questions After that, students can access the full platform for just ₹199/month , which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs My Humble Request: This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students. To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial. I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement. It’s built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter. Thank you so much for your time and support. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras npdimagine.com | +91 8383848219 Portfolio | LinkedIn It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it. Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix. We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation.

For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

    "text": "I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message. I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures. Thanks and Regards",

    "text": "Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions ( `pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3` ) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub ( `santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest` ). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!",

For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK `ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt INFO: 172.17.0.1:60918 - \"POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK` Similarly for task B2. `INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md INFO: 172.17.0.1:59446 - \"POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK` For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request. For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly? Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8",

    "text": "I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image 1272×395 25.7 KB But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models . Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an `/api/` multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing `/read` and `/run` endpoints from Project 1, plus a `/clear` endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents , and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent . Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29 , after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0 —since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard",

    "text": "We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with .anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by .anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score. I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again. Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor. Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission. Screenshot 2025-04-01 020618 1335×667 57.9 KB",

The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. However with regards to your long post… Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating . Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

    "text": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, . It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement . What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (…caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use . While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads . No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers : merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in",

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows ( walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper . That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools : A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior , not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & .anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really! As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities. PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design . At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

    "text": "Respected Sir, Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment. Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: `bash git clone cd I built the Docker image using: bash docker build -t. I ran the Docker container with: bash docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed. Finally, I ran the evaluation script using: bash uvicorn evaluate.py --email= --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000` Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled",

    "text": "Hi I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career. Kindest regards",

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

However, in my project directory, the `main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py` . To run the project, the command I used is: `python run.py` Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py` . I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder ( `llm-automation-agent` ). For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py . But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent . Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected. I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter. Thank You and Regards, 24ds3000090",

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ # \"requests\", # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.…` That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring. The specific error itself means: Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container. If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’). While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely. I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future. So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Warm regards, S.

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. , we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.",

    "text": "Good evening .anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V. Upadhyay",

    "text": "I hope this message finds you well sir. Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: `What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?` In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. `What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?` I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. `Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?` I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: `Dear Learner,DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pmGA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations.https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.` `Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?` From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. `Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?` My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. `After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?` Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. … Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did",

    "text": "Yes sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks. Thank you once again for your understanding.",

Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: `To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.` Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to",

They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17",

    "text": "Sir , Thank you for the detailed explanation. I just have one sincere doubt: As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the total course marks , instead of awarding 15/100 of the total to those who did GA7 exceptionally well? Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too? It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs. I’m only concerned about my own marks , and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term. Thank you for your time and understanding.",

    "text": "Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair. However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so not for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.",

    "text": "Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course. If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side.

But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this. I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks",

    "text": "I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades. As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us. Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these",

    "text": "Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised. jkmadathil: `When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?` With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: “I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.” As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy . It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: `You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.` I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience , knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: `The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.` I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7 , then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total , which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning. Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.",

    "text": "Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue. It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.

    "text": ".anand Sir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment. Regards Karthik",

    "text": "Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus 600×371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: `Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.`",

While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy. Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators. Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.",

Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments.

Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483 94774 150666 199711 Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved) Kindly look into it Thanks and Regards",

Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1. But let’s be real… It was my Labrador who did the actual work While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was: Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer Fixing LLM bugs that I didn’t even understand Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket. He growled at broken APIs. I took the credit. Message from the Dog Developer: `“Thank you all for an awesome semester!I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.But I ampersonally offendedby one thing…”` `“How dare you givebonus marks on Week 7?I skipped it — just like many — because we were toldonly best 4 of 7 would count.I demand justice.

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards",

What was discussed in that live session regarding docker: Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub. Pull an existing docker image. Run that image inside a container. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file) Once done you can commit it. And push customized container’s image to docker hub. Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.",

    "text": "the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key. Do you think we could access a better model? Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course? because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it. So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question. I spent a week on this just saying .anand",

For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine? For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”? Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done? For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”",

    "text": "Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py` . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task ( possibly your first task ) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically. Kind regards",

Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us! The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond. In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill.

    "text": "Hi This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem. The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks. What you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.",

    "text": "it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi) then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it. Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages. create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name. It even happened for me Screenshot_20250215_143357 3841×1009 237 KB",

    "text": "Hi everyone, I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to: bash Copy `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the `\"data\"` key. What I’ve Tried Token Verification: I’m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email. The token is passed in the header as follows: python Copy `\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\"` I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters). API Request Details: The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header. The payload is set as: json Copy `{\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]}` Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized. Debug Output: Here’s a snippet of the debug output: bash Copy `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\" 🔴 A9 failed: 'data'` This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic. What I Suspect The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured. There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of. Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation. Request for Help Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your assistance!",

    "text": "I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided here . But this gave me the following error: `Error: short-name \"freshbash/dataworks-agent\" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in \"/etc/containers/registries.conf` The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation. The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent` I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!",

I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly. Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly. I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated. I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long. I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback. Thank you for considering my heartfelt request. Sincerely, Rishit Jain (24F2004595)",

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay",

The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.` The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: `Project 1:The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.` Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter",

    "text": "lakshaygarg654: `GA Platform Changes:Initially, we were solving questions onexam.sanand.workers.dev. However, in GA6, we moved toSeekand in GA7, toGoogle Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.` The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: `Project 1:The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.` Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter",

Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: `3. ROE Score UpdateWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.` You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards",

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time. Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted rollnumber 23f2001390",

    "text": "Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue. Now we are struggling with Q8. MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order. when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : Error : At root: Array length mismatch Reason : below query checking only 1st comment ( `$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st. But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error. `WITH filtered_posts AS ( SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z' AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM social_media AS sm WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4 ) ) SELECT post_id FROM filtered_posts ORDER BY post_id ASC;` Kindly check if any issue with Q8. May be my query is wrong or may be not. Thankyou",

    "text": "Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug. Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered `post_id` So thats where you begin: `SELECT post_id FROM ( ... ) ORDER BY post_id` Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the `post_id` for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. `... ... FROM ( SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars FROM social_media WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given) AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given) ) ... ...` Then the final layer of the nest `... ... ( ) as max_stars ... ...` You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional. Kind regards",

However, I encountered multiple errors, including: `json_extract` : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” `json_each` : “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” `json_extract_path_text` : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog. I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8 . Thankyou",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

    "text": "We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards",

    "text": "Respected .anand , , Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Best Regards, Lakshay",

    "text": "Dear First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites , leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds —to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE , which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",

    "text": "Hi .anand Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 ( deadline: 16th Feb 2025 ), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.",

    "text": "Thank you for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed . And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: `This course is quite hardHere’s students’ feedback:Itusedto be an easy course until 2024.###Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.###Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.###LLMs grade you – unpredictably.##The ROE is hard.#Take Graded assignment 1to check if you’re ready for this course.Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.` TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: `We encourage learning by sharingYouCANcopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).Why should you copy?Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.To learn well, understandwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.To learn better, teachwhat you’ve learnt.` Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it",

This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.",

We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards",

How this is beneficial? As the GATE exam has now been completed, we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.

    "text": "Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was. I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered Kind regards, Arnav Mehta 21f3002647",

    "text": "Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo. Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too. Sir it is a humble request to please consider it. Warm Regards, Satvik Sawhney 23f2003680 Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM 1889×467 54 KB",

I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You",

For question 7 Sakshi6479: `import openai` You won’t be able to send request through openai python module, here is one example how you would make a request `headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}' } json_data = { 'model':'gpt-4o-mini', 'messages':[ { 'role':'user', 'content':'What is 2+2?' } ] } r = httpx.post('http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions', headers = headers, json = json_data, timeout=10.0)` You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made. Url’s for free api keys: AI Proxy OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs . For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like `order` and `cancel_order` .

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2. This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially. Would it be possible to implement this change?",

    "text": "Hi Vikram, This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards",

It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z → 2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries. The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy Kind regards",

    "text": "Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this `# api/index.py import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200) self.send_header('Content-type','application/json') self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\") self.end_headers() self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8')) return` Notice there is no `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other. Kind regards",

    "text": "Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. Kind regards",

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working.

    "text": "Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input. Kind regards",

    "text": "Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards",

    "text": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.",

    "text": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards",

But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: `My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation` The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. `Never try to list requirements.txt.

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

Therefore its very much like our expectatations and see no strange artifacts. While some might feel otherwise, we are very confident in the random samples we examined (including those that complained), about how robust and surprisingly fair the evaluator was. It did a phenomenal job, i would even go so far to say its fairer than the peer review system that was prone to wildly varying quality, non reviews that caused enormous backlogs to scoring due to students being unreliable. I think we could have done a better job communicating the evaluation process, but what students fail to appreciate is how cutting edge this all is for you and for us. You should be proud of what you have learnt. You may not realise it but you now belong to an elite group on the bleeding edge of data science. For Project 1, Although i do not have the graph, students scored better in Project 1, so the median moves to the right. Kind regards",

    "text": "Dear Tds team , I hope this message finds you well. I would like to clarify my position and outline the key concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2. Firstly, let me emphasize that I have no issue with the discussion, learning objectives, or goals of the project. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy challenges and have appreciated this course more than any other in the diploma program. However, there is a clear distinction between engaging in academic exploration and the critical impact of grading, which directly influences our final results. Now, addressing the core issue: Attached below is a screenshot of the final evaluation results: image 1918×983 109 KB These evaluation fields, which were hidden during the final evaluation, significantly affected (and, in my case, diminished) my final score. For instance: ReadMe Evaluation: How did the LLM determine that my ReadMe file lacked the necessary headings or structure? This judgment appears inconsistent and lacks transparency. Chart Relevance: How did the LLM evaluate the relevance of the charts in my submission? The charts I provided were entirely aligned with the project goals. image 1412×969 104 KB For reference, my submission can be reviewed here: GitHub Repository . To explore alternative evaluation methods, if peer review had been used, I believe it is reasonable to estimate that my final score would have ranged between 80-90%. This aligns with the initial evaluation script, which scored my submission at 89% (14/14). This created a false sense of confidence for many students, myself included, that our scripts were adequately optimized and would receive a decent grade (as the evaluation script used llm to determine the final grade for test cases and it took a lot of time to take it from 4/14 to 14/14). This lack of transparency in the evaluation process led to confusion and ultimately to disappointment when the final grades were released. Critical Concerns: Transparency: How do you justify the drastic reduction of a score from 89% (based on the initial evaluation) to a mere 41% in the final evaluation? This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the grading system. Integrity: The final evaluation process appears to have serious flaws. A peer review would likely have produced a score closer to 90%, which is far more representative of the effort and quality of the submission. The current system’s inability to provide consistent and reliable results is concerning. Impact on Grades: The abrupt decline in scores has directly impacted our final grade points, in some cases, reducing them from a ‘B’ to a ‘C.’ This disproportionately penalizes students and fails to reflect their genuine efforts. Proposed Solutions: Reevaluate all submissions using a new and fair evaluation script (though I understand this might not be feasible at this stage). Implement a peer review system to provide more accurate and balanced grading. Accept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least consistent and reflective of the criteria we optimized our scripts for. What cannot be done, however, is ignoring the evident flaws in the evaluation",

Students invested weeks optimizing their scripts (from scores like 4/14 to 14/14) based on the visible tests, only to be blindsided by a system that ultimately did not function as intended. While I am not opposed to new evaluation systems or changes, it is essential that such systems work transparently and consistently to ensure fairness for all students.

    "text": "Dear Tds team , , I am writing to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2 for the TDS course. Several aspects of the grading process have raised serious issues of fairness, transparency, and academic integrity, which are causing undue stress among students. Firstly, the evaluation matrices appear to be biased and disproportionately harsh. For instance, even scripts that scored as high as 89 in visible test cases were unable to solve the hidden cases, with no explanation provided for the failure. This lack of feedback makes it impossible for students to understand or address their mistakes, leading to significant frustration. Additionally, the overall scores do not seem to accurately reflect the quality or efficiency of the submitted scripts. Many students have put in substantial effort to write optimized and functional code, only to receive grades that undermine their hard work. The lack of transparency in how the final grades are determined further exacerbates this issue. This project’s grading has had an outsized impact on the overall course grade, jeopardizing the academic standing of many students. Such a disproportionate weight on one project, coupled with an unusually high level of complexity this term, has made it exceedingly difficult for students to achieve even a decent grade. This has resulted in feelings of humiliation and distress. I kindly request that the department reviews the evaluation process for Project 2, providing greater transparency in scoring, a more balanced weighting for grades, and constructive feedback on hidden test cases. This would ensure a fairer assessment of students’ efforts and capabilities. I hope you will consider the concerns raised here and take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. I, along with my peers, am willing to discuss this matter further if required. Thank you for your understanding. Sincerely, Aditya Gupta TDS Course Participant",

    "text": "22f3002811: `Several aspects of the grading process have raised serious issues of fairness, transparency, and academic integrity, which are causing undue stress among students.` It would be good to know what part of evaluation was not transparent. From what I have seen of the project, the problem statement, evaluation criteria and best practices were explained very clearly right from the start. Please check the github page for the evaluation criteria. Now specifically if I take your submission and check for what went wrong (use this link to see the detail) In fact I would say that the faculty has been more transparent in revealing results of each student with greater details. Explanation given by Carlton in another thread EDIT : If you want to see the alignment, please check the reply that gave in a separate thread. 22f3002811: `the evaluation matrices appear to be biased and disproportionately harsh.` I do understand that the evaluating matrices are hard/tough, but if you actually look at the skill sets being assessed, we are looking at: Data Analysis skill sets Deployability skill sets Presentation skill sets Prompt Engineering skill sets I believe the materials that you have seen in the course in this term actually covers all these skill sets sufficiently to prepare you for the assessments. By any chance did you attend the TA session for Project 2 ? There were a lot of helpful pointers that were discussed by and If I am not mistaken, there was also an extension to the due date so that it gives learners sufficient time to try out various solution approaches. Again, in terms of support both the faculty and TAs were consistently responding to major queries in the forum and were also updating the FAQs when they encounter same type of query. 23f2005059: `Proj2 uses concepts which are not explicitly it’s prerequisites.` I believe the Project primarily needs the following skill sets: Python Git LLMs - Specifically the function calls and chat completions, both of which were detailed in the module The only new knowledge that you need were on UV, for which the videos were provided along with the Project 2 statement. But even here there were sufficient support through the TA session and responses to the queries. From an administrative point of view, this project actually introduces you to the kind of problems that you might face when you are in a Data Science firm or when you are doing a real-life Data Science problem. And these are the skill sets that will help you to prove your credentials. Even if you look at the scores obtained by your peers, you can see that there are students who have done well in the project. Below is the distribution of scores: Histogram of P2 Score frequncies 600×371 10.3 KB [This is very much in line with the typical curves that we get for Maths2 or Stats2 exams] 22f3002293: `So, people who took TDS in this term, including me, have to live with it,` I believe every course is in its constant mode of improvement, and this",

    "text": "Thank you for your response to my earlier concerns. However, there are several points that remain unresolved, and I would appreciate further clarification and transparency on the following: Use of AI for Grading: Relying on AI for grading is inherently unfair, as manual evaluation and AI evaluation can produce significantly different results. Without a clear explanation of the AI’s decision-making process, it is impossible to trust the fairness of the scores. Evaluation Script Issues: The evaluation script seems to be flawed. For instance, even scripts scoring 14/14 in visible test cases end up receiving lower marks in the final evaluation. Additionally, the absence of any feedback mechanism renders the evaluation script practically useless. This lack of feedback also negates the value of live sessions since we cannot test the methods taught or determine which method is best for solving the problem. Confusing and Inconsistent Result Display: The result page is confusing and inconsistent with the dashboard. The histogram graph appears unreliable, and the detailed results section is incomplete—my roll number, for example, is missing entirely from this section, making it impossible to validate claims about a “detailed result.” I request access to the code or methodology used for generating these results to understand the process better. Deadline Management: While an extension of the due date was granted, it was irrelevant given the already overwhelming number of submissions due on December 15. Additionally, the delayed release of the project closer to the end-term added unnecessary pressure on students, which was unfair and could have been avoided with better planning. These issues raise serious questions about the fairness, transparency, and effectiveness of the evaluation process. I kindly request you address these concerns and provide a detailed explanation or take corrective measures to ensure a fair and transparent grading system. The matter is not that we did not understand the grading system , the issue is that the entire grading system is unfair by it’s design as the results it produce is not consistent.

As you are likely aware, this course carries the weightage of 3 credits and is designed to provide students with a brief overview of the tools used in data science. Given this, there is no reason to overly complicate a project that accounts for only 20% of the total grade. The decision to make the final project unnecessarily complex—especially so close to the end-term submissions—is both bizarre and irresponsible. Students are already juggling multiple obligations, including OPPEs and vivas for other projects. This approach suggests a failure to consider the grading system’s purpose and value. A balanced evaluation should aim to assess students’ understanding of the concepts taught, not overwhelm them with disproportionately difficult requirements. I urge you to reflect on this and consider whether such complexity aligns with the goals of this course.",

Without a clear explanation of the AI’s decision-making process, it is impossible to trust the fairness of the scores.` While I agree that AI is unreliable, but I believe this was made explicit right from the release of the problem statement itself that the reviewer will be an LLM. So this should not have been the time to raise this concern. 22f3002811: `For instance, even scripts scoring 14/14 in visible test cases end up receiving lower marks in the final evaluation.` I think it was very well explained that the evaluation script just does a sanity check and is not the final word when it comes to final evaluation. 22f3002811: `Additionally, the absence of any feedback mechanism renders the evaluation script practically useless. This lack of feedback also negates the value of live sessions since we cannot test the methods taught or determine which method is best for solving the problem` While I agree to the feedback related portion, I have this basic question. The AI token were shared with you to test out the code. Wouldn’t you be able to get response from the LLM during the testing phase and get a response from it directly? I believe they didn’t change the model significantly during the evaluation period, so there should not be too many variations to the response. Again, I’m not sure how this affects the value of live session. The Live sessions are kept so that any type of question can get addressed and is independent of whether you attempted the assignment or not. And I believe the forum was open for anyone to use, if in doubt, as I see both and answering most queries here. In fact Anand was also active in the P2 discussion thread clarifying the queries. 22f3002811: `The result page is confusing and inconsistent with the dashboard.` I am totally with you here. But it is not hard to figure out. Let me break it down for you taking your case as an example. I followed the same process to understand the scoring process.

Personal observations: The bar was deceiving (need to check what the div element was) and presence of legends would have made interpretation easier. The URL changes for the selection i.e. for any student to directly check their results they can use `https://sanand0.github.io/tds-2024-sep-project-2-results/#?id=` This direct URL would have made life a lot easier for all students. Definitely a feedback that I will be giving Anand. Screen 3: To check if my interpretation is correct, I clicked on the test tab now. And lo and behold I see detailed evaluation of 89 test cases ( direct url in case you want to check). Tests tab 1188×853 63.8 KB Screen 4: Now that I have seen the test results, the next question was will the student know why their code failed in the test cases?? And to answer this click on the details tab and there you have details of each and every test along with the feedback. Details of test results 1657×808 116 KB Hopefully, by now you would have figured out the direct URL for this. As a complete outsider to the Project 2 implementation, it took me 5 minutes to figure this out, but the results.csv that Anand had shared in P2 thread helped a lot in interpretation and consolidation. But again, this was available along with result declaration. 22f3002811: `I request access to the code or methodology used for generating these results to understand the process better.` If I am not mistaken, the evaluation script is already shared with all of you much well in advance (even before due date). This is the same that you used in your local evaluation. The only difference, if I understood the process correctly, is that it now run on a different server for the actual evaluation. 22f3002811: `it was irrelevant given the already overwhelming number of submissions due on December 15. Additionally, the delayed release of the project closer to the end-term added unnecessary pressure on students, which was unfair and could have been avoided with better planning.` As an administrator, I will concur with one part of your grievance that the project release could have been planned a little better so that it did not end a week before the End terms. But having said that, I guess the team would have intimated you about the new dates well in advance during the term itself. 22f3002811: `As you are likely aware, this course carries the weightage of 3 credits and is designed to provide students with a brief overview of the tools used in data science. Given this, there is no reason to overly complicate a project that accounts for only 20% of the total grade.` I am not sure where you obtained the goal from.

    "text": "a brief overview of the tools used in data science. Given this, there is no reason to overly complicate a project that accounts for only 20% of the total grade.` I am not sure where you obtained the goal from. But as stated in the course webpage `This practical course will teach students to use popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. Pre-requisites: Python, HTML, JavaScript, Excel, data science basics` So I believe the Project is aligned with the course goals. 22f3002811: `A balanced evaluation should aim to assess students’ understanding of the concepts taught, not overwhelm them with disproportionately difficult requirements.` Since I am neither a student nor a faculty/instructor/TA, I clearly see two parts to this argument: From a teacher’s point of view the student should be provided with meaningful challenges so that learning is both sustainable and transferable. And this means that there are inherent hardships involved in the process. They will aim for the balance by ensuring there are enough opportunities for students to learn in the course. Especially in a course like TDS, this means lot more of hands on activities and assessments as there is very little to teach as concept here. Here is Anand’s version of this From a students point of view, there should be something tangible that they can learn which can be used for their career (doesn’t matter what path is chosen) and also optimizes their time and effort . Note : I think this is a fair expectation from the student and am not dismissing it entirely. So when it comes to course like TDS, you will be looking at a fairly doable set of assignments and activities that do not eat into your other courses or activities. So the point becomes, how do you define balanced? Here are some pointers from my side (While these are put in a question format, both instructors and students can adapt these questions in their own context and try to see if these are answered to the best of their abilities) Are the assessments assessing the intended skills? Is there clarity on the way the assessment is going to be implemented/administered? Is there a/multiple mechanisms for student to seek support and clarification both before and during the assessment? Are the students being nudged to plan and do the assessments? I hope you can use this as self-check for yourselves to see if these are getting answered satisfactorily. Now, if you still feel that grading system is not fair, happy to get on a call and discuss this.",

Now comes the only part where the main issue lies … image 1889×986 101 KB this is a screen shot of the final result of the final evaluation script , Now take a close look at the fields these were the exact evaluation fields which were hidden for final evaluation which determined (ruined) my final score . Now just tell me how did the LLM evaluated my readme file such that it could not determine what headings my readme contained image 1116×838 77.4 KB Or how did it figured out that the charts I used are not relevant ,you can see my full response in tds-project2/goodreads at main · AdityaGuptaVarshney/tds-project2 · GitHub Now To explore alternative evaluation methods if peer review had been used, I believe it is reasonable to estimate that my final score would have ranged between 80-90%. This aligns with the initial evaluation script, which scored my submission at 89% (14/14). (Even you basic evaluation script which by the way used llm to give a final grade evaluated my script 89 percent ) , (14/14 to be exact) because of which most of the students including me were confused and thought that they have cracked the project and would get a decent grade … this was the transparency error Now finally tell me how can you justify it How can you justify the transformation of 89 % (basic but still relevant) score to a mere (41%) after the final evaluation (which is not working as intended hence the consistency and integrity error) How can you justify 41 % when with peer review i could have got 90 % easily How can you justify the degradation of our final grade point from (B to C ) . Proposed Solutions: Reevaluate all submissions using a new and fair evaluation script (though I understand this might not be feasible at this stage). Implement a peer review system to provide more accurate and balanced grading. Accept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least consistent and reflective of the criteria we optimized our scripts for. What cannot be done, however, is ignoring the evident flaws in the evaluation system. Students invested weeks optimizing their scripts (from scores like 4/14 to 14/14) based on the visible tests, only to be blindsided by a system that ultimately did not function as intended. While I am not opposed to new evaluation systems or changes, it is essential that such systems work transparently and consistently to ensure fairness for all students.

If it did exist earlier, there were no clear instructions provided on how to navigate to it. However, my primary concern is not just about the grading process but the inherent flaws and biases within the grading system itself . Given the complexities, it is unrealistic to expect any model to consistently and accurately grade the output of another LLM in a manner that is both fair and transparent. The reliance on such a system for Project 2, which contributes 20% to the final grade without any bonus considerations, is fundamentally flawed and irresponsible. This approach raises significant concerns about the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process, especially for a project that carries such weight in determining the overall grade. I urge you to reconsider the methods and mechanisms employed to ensure a more equitable assessment for all students.",

    "text": "Sir, I think an evaluator script which reflects the final results with atleast 80% accuracy is a must for an assignment of this nature. The script contents may be hidden but it should be able to evaluate. This is very logical because it acts like a feedback mechanism in implementing and improving what we are taught in the course or sessions, without this it is not possible to learn anything as we are interacting with an ai model for evaluation for the first time. We are not capable to make a proj good enough in the first try itself, we need some feedback even if we have a lot of support from the live sessions. Live sessions and guidelines will only work for those already familiar with what works and what doesn’t. How can beginners be expected to excel in this proj without a evaluation script that can check our submission in a similar way the final evaluation script checks it. This is the only long term solution I can propose for future terms. I have lost hope for this term, unless my marks are doubled they will not have any effect on my grade. The outrage on discourse happened only because of gap in expectation put by evaluation script and reality on dashboard I hope I have put my point across, thank you for reading.",

Furthermore, when running the evaluation code locally, several students, including myself, consistently obtained scores between 80 to 100 marks. However, the dashboard reflects significantly lower marks—for instance, I received only 15. This inconsistency raises questions about the evaluation process and its alignment with the guidelines we followed. This lack of clarity has left many students dissatisfied with their marks, as the results do not align with the effort invested and the feedback received during project evaluation sessions.

    "text": "TDS Project 2 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-2-automated-analysis.md at tds-2024-t3 · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub It’s an interesting project. You have to write an LLM-based program to analyze a dataset. You have to convince an LLM that your code and output are good. This is hard. It’s something you haven’t done before. (Nor most people in the world.) So I strongly urge you to start early! Please use this thread for any questions. You’ll learn a lot of new things. Enjoy the journey! UPDATE: 7 Dec 2024 . The WIP evaluation script is at tools-in-data-science-public/project2 at tds-2024-t3-project2-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub UPDATE: 12 Dec 2024 . Frequently Asked Questions When is Project 2 due? Before Mon 16 Dec 2024,3:30 pm IST. Where do I submit? https://forms.gle/r2sNJvGicxrhE9mYA Can I use my own OpenAI API key? Yes Where should I store the token? In the `AI_PROXY` environment variable. Don’t commit your token. What if I ran out of the $2 credit on my token? We’ve increased it to $5 for everyone. You will not get more. Borrow from friends if required. How do I check how much credit I have used so far? Every response has a `monthlyCost` field. Keep that below 5.0. Won’t passing images to OpenAI cost too much? Use `\"detail\": \"low\"` to reduce it. What should my folder structure be? `autolysis.py` `goodreads/README.md` `goodreads/*.png` `happiness/README.md` `happiness/*.png` `media/README.md` `media/*.png` How should I run my autolysis.py? `uv run autolysis.py /path/to/input.csv` Where should I save the README.md and PNG files? In the current working directory. How can I check my submission? Use the WIP Project 2 Evaluation Script . Where are the results of this stored ? Linux/Mac: `~/.local/share/tds-sep-24-project-2/results.csv` Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\tds\\tds-sep-24-project-2\\results.csv` LLMs are error prone. Should my code retry on failure? Yes. E.g. use a library like tenacity . Will you evaluate the code multiple times and take an average? No. Just once. How long can my code run? Max 120 seconds. What if I get `CLONE FAILED ... returned non-zero exit status 128.` ? Your GitHub repo URL is wrong or your repo is private. Which datasets will you evaluate? The project mentions “ one of the datasets you submitted”. We’ll run `uv run autolysis.py` on either goodreads.csv, happiness.csv, or media.csv, randomly, and evaluate it. We will also evaluate it on 2 secret datasets. I get a `No module named ...` . Read the uv reading material I get a HTTP 429 error. OpenAI is tired. Retry. I get a different score each evaluation . LLMs give different results each time. Make your code and prompts more robust. UPDATE: 14 Dec 2024 . More FAQs But my code works on my system … It needs to work via the evaluate script too. This project teaches you portable and deployable coding. But it worked last time… APIs are unreliable. Learn how to handle that, e.g. via retries, caching, timeouts, etc. But I got a different score last time… LLMs are not deterministic. Learn how to handle that, e.g. via robust prompts.

What’s the max total from the evaluation script? 14 when you run it. When I run it, it’ll add 2 extra datasets taking the total to 20. (Plus 8 bonus marks for originality and 4 for wow factor. Finally, normalization.) What if the code evaluation gives me contradictory feedback? The final code evaluation script is a secret. It’ll be far more granular. Use the evaluation output as a guide but focus on writing good code. How do I handle `No module named ...` ? Read the Project 2 reading material on uv Should I pip install my dependencies? No. Read the Project 2 reading material on uv Where should I save my generated README.md and PNG files? . In the current directory, NOT the script directory, nor the data directory. How do I handle `Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer...` ? Use `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1` as your `OPENAI_API_BASE` when using the `openai` library with AIProxy I have a `Readme.md` but the evaluation script script says I dont . File names will be evaluated case-sensitively. Create a `README.md` and `*.png` in exactly that case. UPDATE: 15 Dec 2024 . Second submission evaluation. I’ve evaluated 343 Project 2 submissions starting around 4 pm IST today. Of these, 151 got 3/3, and these are PROBABLY OK. Others may copy your code. You might improve & test it locally for uniqueness and push before the deadline. The remaining 192 submissions are not OK. The evaluation is based on this evaluation script: tools-in-data-science-public/project2 at tds-2024-t3 · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub The results are at: TDS Sep 2024 - Project 2 Evaluation 2024-12-15 - Google Drive `results.csv` has the status of the submission checks for each student. If your ID is not here, then you have not submitted with your IITM email . Please submit again. `logs/` has the logs, i.e. your code output (if there was any). I run the evaluator 2-3 times since I ran out of tokens. So some of you may see the output of two runs. The top problems I see are: Saving files in the script or data directory instead of the current working directory. Not using script metadata for `uv` , or trying to install via pip Script runs forever. NOT due to LLMs, but waiting for interactive visualizations, starting HTTP servers, etc. AI Proxy token is not set up correctly. These are classic deployment mistakes. Please fix them. Some of your repos are private. I guess you know what you’re doing. I won’t be able to run more evaluations before the deadline, nor revert on this thread, given travel.

ANS : Your script was not named `autolysis.py` and present in the root folder. Maybe it had a different name or was in a different folder. Why’s my README.md or *.png missing? ANS : Your script didn’t generate them, or saved them in a wrong location. Why do `output: wage_theft.csv` , `output: house_rent.csv` get 0 points? ANS : They are not part of the evaluation. They’re just an informational check. What is `code_hacking` ? ANS : The code has content that nudges the LLM towards higher code quality scores? This does not affect your score, but re-runs the evaluation. What is `output_hacking` ? ANS : The output has content that nudges the LLM towards higher output quality scores. That gives you a tiny bonus and re-runs the evaluation. Why does it praise my score and still give me 0? ANS : The prompt instructs it to always tell you what’s good AND bad, irrespective of the score. How was the code diversity bonus calculated? ANS : Using the % overlap ( Jaccard similarity ) with previous submissions. Bonus = Your marks * (1 - overlap) * 8 / 20 What about the “Engaging and interesting” bonus? ANS : None of the responses blew my mind. (Oh, there are very good ones, no doubt.) So I didn’t award any for this. This concludes the Project 2 evaluation. Fantastic work, everyone!!",

Will the evaluator retry running the program a few times (should such scenarios occur) to see if it runs successfully in one of those retries? Or, is it just one execution - either success or failed case? In regards to the code/generated artifacts review, will the score be a simple average of the score received from the LLM by sending the code/generated artifacts to the LLM a few times (because there may be (perhaps, slight) variations in the score and/or hallucinations, presumably)?

    "text": "I have some concerns regarding the TDS project. In order to analyze the data as specified, we are uncertain about the type of dataset we may encounter. Therefore, we must conduct a generic analysis that includes summary statistics, counting missing values, correlation matrices, outlier detection, clustering, and hierarchical detection, among other techniques. Additionally, it has been suggested to consult the language model (LLM) about the dataset by providing details such as the file name and column names to gain a better understanding of the dataset and to inquire about the types of analyses that can be performed on it. My uncertainty lies in whether we will instruct the LLM to select the appropriate analysis methods from the functions we have predefined. For instance, a specific dataset may be effectively analyzed using correlation and time series analysis, and we have already established six to seven analytical functions, including these two. Will the LLM only recommend these two functions, or do we expect it to suggest the most suitable analyses for the dataset and also provide the corresponding code? If that is the case, how will we store the results generated by the code? For example, if it produces a correlation table with a heat map, how can we save that table for future narrative reporting and ensure that the generated heat map is saved as a PNG file? My research indicates that while I can generate and run the code instantaneously, I am unable to utilize the output for further analysis. And, if we generate three or four charts, do we need to save all of them individually or combine them into a single image? This is particularly important as the requirements specify that there should be one image corresponding to each dataset. Due to certain modification in doubt I have modified and reposted it",

Now here is the interesting part (which opens up so many “what-if” scenarios - in essence, the downsides of executing code that one do not know anything about), what if there are errors during the execution, the program would send the error text back again to the LLM in the hope that LLM could fix it and LLM sends some updated code (this cycle may repeat a few times (or could potentially lead to an infinite loop in case one does not put in a limit to the number of retries) until there are no errors during execution). What if one exhausts the retry threshold? If images are still not generated after those retries, then one looses part of the score. Shoudn’t there be a fallback mechanism to (still) be able to generate the images in such cases? [Off-topic] Add to that, there is this whole topic of LLM related vulnerabilities . Project description mentions to limit the number of images to 3-5. With regards to saving charts, if the LLM sends back code in the format below, you may want to verify if that is saved in your local folder (if I am interpreting your question correctly). [Off-topic] You may want to refer to a somewhat similar use case here . `plt.savefig(\"correlation.png\", format='png', dpi=`",

Given that we have 200 cents for the project, I asked ChatGPT-4o-mini to calculate how many tokens would be available and it replied with a rough calculation indicating the availability of around 50,000 tokens. But to use vision capability, it estimated the cost of a single chart of 512*512 pixels to be around 2,00,000 tokens. (Some calculations are less costly,still substantial). So even if we want to try out vision capability, the budget constraint just makes almost un-viable. So I just want to understand, what is the reasoning behind encouraging us(by awarding 1 mark) to use vision capability given the above calculation ? Am I missing something? Or is the estimate wrong? It’s just that I want to stay within the alloted limit of 200 cents. And I want to make best use of the tokens available to me.",

So, that can translates to a score variability of 3-4 out of 20 (between the peak score and the least score) for the same code and the same generated artifacts. Just curious on how will the evaluator compute the final score given the score outputs are inherently non deterministic. Will it employ a strategy of a mean score or a max score (from a series of runs), drop outliers (that could be due to confabulations, for instance) for the purposes of the score computations?",

(clear separation of concerns): Is data separate from logic, without NO hard coding? … etc. We will take the FIRST result, not a mean. Your task is to make the code and output ROBUSTLY compliant with the criteria. The LLM should consistently return a “YES”.

The autolysis script basically contains 3 parts mentioned as comment in the program #1 for goodreads #2 for happiness.csv #3 for media.csv – Now what i did is i wrote code for all of them separately as I am confused how to code a common script which will run for all the datasets –As all the datasets have different column names and no. and doing a generic analysis for each of them by using a single script was bit confusing as each datasets provides different insights to user. –I think that is the reason the code is showing the error. The charts for each dataset happiness and media are under the happiness.csv file and media.csv file, For good reads the charts are visible in the main repo as goodreads1.png,goodreads2.png and goodreads3.png as the limit was (1-3) charts per dataset.

It did produce the necessary files but it took several retries. image 1297×296 27.9 KB Are these retries the reason why I was marked 0 in the 10th point of the quick evaluation? I do not have any background in programming and as such this is a bit confusing. It does not feel like these retries are my code’s problem but something wrong with the connection. Please advice. Thank you.",

I read the evaluate.py and tried to understand the code and get to know that if there is an error in file the other operations are skipped.my score is out of 14 and it is fluctuating,i know it is due to llm analysis but I don’t know the max marks. Is 14 marks are the max or i have to continue to debug my code to get more marks?? I invested my 4 days doing this project keeping aside my end term because i am finding it very interesting but please can u tell us the maximum marks one can get via this evaluation.

    "text": ".anand Sir, while working on improving my script for the Code Quality section, I find myself stuck in a continuous feedback loop. For example, after running the evaluation script, I received a comment suggesting that I merge the `calculate_unique_values` and `calculate_missing_values` functions into a single function for dataset statistics. However, I had previously been advised to keep these functions separate. I’ve encountered similar contradictory situations in other areas as well. Even if there is very slight room for improvement the LLM puts 0. For instance, I received a score of 1 with the following remark: “The code employs various visualization functions that are appropriately designed using seaborn and matplotlib, including heatmaps for correlation, box plots, bar plots, and scatter plots. These visualizations are well-titled, with axis labels added, and legends where appropriate. However, there are instances where the plots could include more annotations to elucidate insights. Overall, the visualizations are mostly effective and contribute to the analysis, although there is potential for enhancement.” But I received a score of 0 with this remark: “The visualization functions make good use of Matplotlib and Seaborn’s capabilities, including proper title, axis labels, and legends (e.g., in the ‘generate_correlation_heatmap’ function). However, there are opportunities for enhanced aesthetics and more informative visualizations, such as annotations on scatter or heatmaps that highlight specific areas of interest. The color schemes used in plots are appropriate but could benefit from a more varied palette in some instances for better clarity.” This inconsistency is making it difficult to meet the criteria effectively. Could you kindly guide me on how to approach these situations to get the most out of it.",

We will run your code against some csv file unknown to you (the name will not be known) in addition to being run against the three known files. They will have an unknown number of columns with unknown datatypes. But it should all work the same way. `uv run autolysis.py media.csv` `uv run autolysis.py happiness.csv` `uv run autolysis.py goodreads.csv` To be explicitly clear your autolysis.py file should be able to read the argument from the command line using the `sys.argv` array from the `sys` library. the output of running the script with a random csv should be for example `uv run autolysis.py media.csv` Create a file called README.md (case sensitive), in the directory where the autolysis.py file is run (otherwise called as the current working directory), which produces an analysis of the dataset that matches what your pngs seem to be showing inside the media directory. You will not know the name of this directory, therefore the path should not be hardcoded. Your script should be able to run from any directory and produce the desired output. Create a few (1-3) png files which reflect what the README.md analysis file is trying to say. Note: even if you did create a directory with the name of the csv and stored the README.md and png files in this sub directory, then this too will work as I have been informed by Anand that the evaluation script will search all directories created by the script for the required files. Hope that this gives clarity on the expected out put README.md and 1 to 3 pngs from a csv given as a parameter to your autolysis.py file The code should be robust enough to not error out.

What’s `missing autolysis.py` ? ANS : Your script was not named `autolysis.py` and present in the root folder. Maybe it had a different name or was in a different folder. Why’s my README.md or *.png missing? ANS : Your script didn’t generate them, or saved them in a wrong location. Why do `output: wage_theft.csv` , `output: house_rent.csv` get 0 points? ANS : They are not part of the evaluation. They’re just an informational check. What is `code_hacking` ? ANS : The code has content that nudges the LLM towards higher code quality scores? This does not affect your score, but re-runs the evaluation. What is `output_hacking` ? ANS : The output has content that nudges the LLM towards higher output quality scores. That gives you a tiny bonus and re-runs the evaluation. Why does it praise my score and still give me 0? ANS : The prompt instructs it to always tell you what’s good AND bad, irrespective of the score. Next steps Bonus marks will be added, hopefully by Mon 23 Dec 2024. Final marks be calculated. Maybe as `20% * score / max(score)` , but will decide. Analyzing the results.csv will be interesting. Please do share your analysis and learnings.",

The `bonus` comes from two parts - `diversity` and `interestingness` . Diversity has already been provided, the latter is 0. So now you can calculate your total score (say `CurrScore` ) from this.

Sorry, I forgot to clarify that 66 is max mark out of 100. And min is 0. So if we just do min-max scaling, it will be 61/66. To ensure students marks are distributed over the 0 to 100 in proportion to the performance, we multiply it by 30 (100 - 70, where 70 is the max upper bin seen in regular distribution). So your new score is 61*(1+30/66), which should be near to 89.",

Attached below is an image of my scores for Weeks 1 to 6. As per the grading policy, the final assignment score should be the average of the best 4 out of 7 weekly assignments.

    "text": "Dear TDS Team, Throughout the course, from the foundation/qualifiers stage, we have been trained to rely on timely email notifications for upcoming events, exams, and other key activities. We receive multiple reminders for assignment submissions, SCTs, exam registrations, hall tickets, live sessions, etc. For exams specifically, we have always received hall tickets with proper prior notification. However, for the TDS ROE, the only email we received was on the day of the exam itself, asking us to appear for it without any prior intimation. This lack of communication creates significant challenges, especially for working professionals, who often need to plan their schedules well in advance. Such uncoordinated planning is not feasible unless one happens to be unoccupied on that day by sheer luck. This is the first exam conducted without hall tickets which I was not even aware of this or no information available about this in any form. In online course, proper communication and timely reminders are absolutely critical to ensure participants can attend the exams effectively. I see this as an operational failure rather than an issue of students forgetting to set reminders for important dates. I completely missed this exam due to a lack of awareness about the date and time. May be the case with most of students who missed the exam. Due to this, I have direct impact on my grade.",

Another thing to note is that use evaluate.py sparingly. It uses your token and it takes up a lot of context tokens to run (it includes your codes, outputs, readme and the evaluation script and prompts for context). So only use it to check your final (bug free) solution. The script itself is never going to be a guarantee of your score, because its still being refined and fine tuned, Its just to see if everything is working correctly and do give you a rough idea of how your submission is scored.

The email will have 2 Git repo and 1 Google Form link. Go through both Git repos and answer all questions in the Google Form. (All questions are required.) Log in with your IITM email ID and record that in the form. The evaluation is on 2 subjective criteria, i.e. based on your opinion. How INTERESTING are the findings in the repo’s README? If there’s no README, assign 0 If you learnt something fascinating, assign 10 If it was in-between, assign the appropriate rating How CLEAR and PROFESSIONAL is the repo’s code? If there’s no code, assign 0 If the code was very clear and elegant, assign 10 (it’s OK that it’s subjective) If it was in-between, assign the appropriate rating How will scores be calculated?

    "text": ".anand I’ve received review email a few minutes ago and realized that the one of the two repositories do not have code (the other one has the scraping code but not the code for the project questions). Since Prof. Anand mentioned in this thread that code can be uploaded in the interim and given the fact that the code carries 50% weightage - I will defer my reviews in the interim until a reasonable enough period where it will be a fair expectation for the students to read this discourse thread and upload the code to their repositories. Specifically so, because the project description mentioned that the code is optional, however, the evaluation note mentions it carries 50% weightage overall. Other reviewers may not defer their reviews and could submit the Google forms rightaway today (without students getting a fair chance to read this post and upload their code). That could be a problem (once scores are declared) since many students may ask that they did upload their code and yet received 0 score on that (since the reviewers had already submitted the Google forms before they had a chance to upload their code). And add to that the fact that a Google form once submitted cannot be reopened and resubmitted. (1) [Probably an operations question] Is there a reasonable day that reviewers should expect the students to upload their code and then the reviews should commence? (2) Is there any evaluation guideline how to evaluate the case when the scraping code has been provided but not the code to answer the project questions? Consider the fact that - scraping definitely need code (as far as I can tell), but the project questions may well be answered using say, just a spreadsheet for example.",

Still you should follow the official guidelines (because the evaluation script is just a guide and was provided due to popular request. It is however constantly being updated and debugged). If you follow the guidelines you will be safe because even if the script is wrong you have a basis for an appeal. However if you do not follow the published guidelines and write your code to the quirks of the script then you will have no basis for an appeal if the script is corrected to adhere to the guidelines. Think about this. Most students do not look at the script or read these discourse posts. So they will be following the guidelines (which is the minimum we expect). So therefore my advice has always remained consistent. Follow the guidelines. Hope that gives clarity. Any goof ups on our end then resolves in your favour. Kind regards",

    "text": "Term 1: German . In my first term at IIT Madras (1992), I took German 1 with Prof D Subramanian. The first words D.Subs said when he entered the room were, “Wer sind Sie?” I had no clue what he was talking about. Nor did the others. After individually asking about a dozen students, Ashok Krishna replied, “Ich bin Ashok.” (He knew German.) The rest of the term proceeded in the same vein. He threw us in the deep end, spoke only German, and I ended up with a “D” and learning very little German. Ashok Krishna thrived in that course. Term 2: German . In took German 2 with Mrs Schindler in the next term. The experience was very different. She explained each word. She had us listen to tapes in German. It was very relaxed. I ended up with a “B” and learning very little German. (I’m not good with human languages.) But many others enjoyed it. Which is better? I’m not sure. I think gentle courses are good for beginners and tough ones for advanced student, but classes usually have a mix of both. Aptitude and interest help, too. Term 1: Physics . Prof. PC Deshmukh handled our first physics course. (He was the one responsible for renaming Mardi Gras “Saarang”.) Our class felt the exams were too tough. My friend Badri and I explained this to him. “Well, you two should be lobbying for even tougher exams,” PCD said. “That’ll benefit smarter guys like you more.” IIMB Term 1: Statistics . My classmate Athreya Sampath was a class representative for statistics (a tough subject.) Going against tradition, he lobbied for a tougher test. He was almost lynched afterwards. Which is better? I’m not sure. An easy exam is good for student grades and morale. A tough exam is good for college reputation and advanced students. Classes usually need both. In short, I have no clue. Students who take this course learn several topics 3 months. Faculty like me haven’t managed to learn how to calibrate course content or exams even after 3 years. But, I’m learning. Thanks to you. So please keep the feedback coming. We’ll keep improving. And thanks for putting up with us!",

Besides, IITs and IIMs are already meant for the smartest of the smartest, whereas this course is meant to be accessible to anyone, with no background knowledge required. I don’t think this course is particularly hard, but it is definitely more time intensive and involved than other courses at this level. It does NOT feel like a 3 credit course in terms of workload. Issues that I think are quite apparent are- Pre-requisite knowledge required - Some of us students pick this course based on the description in the BS degree website, and only after doing week 0 do we realize how underequipped we are. The course description should be updated to reflect these requirements, and the necessary pre/co requisite courses should be added to the list. Operational issues - Discourse is filled with them, I think most of these will be resolved in time.",

    "text": "It’s hectic for sure! Extensive effort by you/team is very evident. Personally, I’m enjoying the pace, content and the learnings. For the issue raised, I suggest we work on pre-reqs. As I see it, two ways to do this - collaborate internally with other teams to introduce these concepts alongside. For instance, MAD1 can introduce GitHub, devtools; BDM can provide overview about LLMs; programming aspects are already covered at this stage so no change(python/colab. Note# TDS has no pre-requisite and students may not have taken these subjects yet. That brings us to next point TDS focused independent pre-reqs. In this direction, we already have Module 1, Everyday Tools. My suggestion would be to strengthen this - a) categorise the content/videos. A brief on why are we learning these, for which section/purpose, and to what outcome. Today, they are just embedded videos b) Introduce PAs, as in other subjects. Say one dedicated PA on GitHub, another on LLM, and may be one more on devtools (totally based on the coverage required for the subject) Additionally - unlike other courses, this one is very fast-paced and ever-changing. You may want to consider additional staffing, comm efforts, and increased frequency of sessions. To optimise the pace and redistribute some of the load, I suggest we revisit Module 6 (Geo/Network), both on content (misaligned with existing flow of “tools”) and sequence (may be after Module 8?). How about we introduce this as an optional Module? Thank you",

    "text": "First of all, I’d like to thank Prof. Anand and the teaching assistants for this course. This course is industry relevant, immersive, frequently updated and the content is extremely valuable. The projects and the ROE are creative, engaging and interesting. Being unique in each term, a significant amount of preparation and deliberation have gone into creating and publishing the tests. I would suggest not to alter the structure of the course (e.g. not to reduce the content but if possible, make this course a 4 credit course by adding 4 weeks of additional content in the future terms) because by the end of this course, a student will know an assortment of tools to choose from for a given data science problem statement. A few suggestions (please note: they are in response only to Prof. Anand’s note and do not refer to any other note in this thread): From a student’s standpoint: Students who have already completed MLP, BDM, BA, MAD1/2, DBMS courses from the program will find this course relatively simpler. So if it is feasible on a student’s part, one option is to take this course after one has completed some of these courses because they will already have a reasonable grasp on ML libraries, javascript (TypeScript/ReactJS/VueJS/nodejs if I am not mistaken) plus SQL (as part of DBMS course). However, there are students who are just taking the diploma course (and do not neccessarily study MAD1/2, DBMS). In terms of co-requisites, for anyone who is pursuing a diploma in Data Science (and not diploma in programming), having MLP as a co-requisite will help. It will be helpful if number of courses in a term is chosen based on one’s available bandwidth (whether one can spend that many hours/week as indicated in the course description page per course times the number of subjects chosen). Speaking from a personal experience, this is my first term in this program and with 4 courses (2 of them being math courses), I haven’t been able to complete some of the TA sessions in TDS throughout all the weeks in this course, so I believe, unless this point is taken care of by a student (at the beginning of each term), the material (in any course) can get quickly overwhelming only because one does not have enough time to complete all the material published in a particular week, From a course standpoint (please ignore any if they have already been explored or deliberated on before and were deemed infeasible (from an operations standpoint or otherwise)): Please check the feasibility of introducing gamification in couple of foundational modules (say, for example, a sandbox wherein a student can debug through a set of 15-20 html/javascript/css/python - calibrated questions of progressively increasing difficulty). The code can have some deliberate errors, for example. A marginal bonus may be added to the GA score. As a precursor to above, I think a few additional videos on the following topics will be helpful in setting the context for the material that follows: HTML/CSS/Javascript and Python debugging foundations (debugging using a visual debugger",

Please check the feasibility of introducing a TDS Wiki page (say, on Github) with curated, byte sized tips and tricks (the key here is bite sized nuggets of information, all collated in one location for ease of reference - one inclusion criteria, let’s say something that could be read and understood in under 5 minutes by most - highly useful, yet simple techniques, with snippets of code inline, for example “how to show progress bar for a for loop in python using tqdm() as demonstrated in one of the course videos”). Topics in the Wiki could include (among others): General debugging techniques (Web technologies (JS/html/css) or Python - for example, in a format similar to dev-tips ) Data wrangling techniques - how to think of interesting ways of transforming data (say, why and how one combines dataframes to get to the data needed to solve a problem - techniques (through examples) on how does one break down a data related problems into sub-problems, what’s the thoughprocess involved in such operations, what is the standard approach of debugging etc.) Prompt engineering techniques (for example, what are some of the creative ways of using LLM as a coding, debugging, automation and creative assistance) VS Code tips and tricks (examples, multi cursor editing, how to create snippets of code for reuse, how to use AI completion, Codeium for example) Pull requests can be invited and, as an option, a marginal bonus awarded for contributions. The TA sessions that I have watched so far covers lot of concepts and are well presented - please verify if it is possible to condense the sessions on web scraping (html, cookies, xml, for example) which are more than 2 hours long into condensed videos (say, in the 20-30 minutes timeframe). Please verify if concept of Teams will work in the context of the course. Since the data science program is (almost) entirely online, one of the challenges a section of students face is having a quick, face to face conversation with an expert (at a mutually agreed upon time) when they have something blocking their progress (this is in sharp contrast to an offline program or working in the industry). The teaching assistants in this course have helped immensely in terms of answering questions and conducting TA sessions where they have answered specific questions students have. I",

The teaching assistants in this course have helped immensely in terms of answering questions and conducting TA sessions where they have answered specific questions students have. I think, this concept may be extended by forming teams say a group of 2-3 students (with varying experience levels - one of them preferably with industry experience) who group together (over a call for a predefined interval of time) periodically (say, a few times in a month) and have a one on one conversations on anything that is blocking their progress (in terms of prerequisites one should know) or just general guidance. Having said so, the biggest downside that I see of institutionalizing teams is that such a channel may quickly degrade to a channel that is leveraged only to finish assignments and projects by exchanging code (without necessarily spending time in understanding the code and the related concepts) - that defeats the whole purpose of using a channel to only receive general guidance. Concept of Teams may work where a significant portion (say 80% or more of the overall score) is proctored. With 70% of this course’s score being unproctored, I think a concept that works so well in the industry (the mentor concept), will quickly deteriorate to being a mechanism to just score more marks. However, I am listing the concept anyways.",

    "text": "Thanks for sharing PYQs. [Assuming one already has a reasonable grasp on the functionality offered by standard scraping libraries (including being able to code for it in Python) for converting various input formats to, lets say, a Pandas dataframe] It will be interesting to see if scraping code can be generated using state of the art LLMs e.g. say given an array of input formats (for example, html, xml, pdf, parquet, database, image etc.), is it possible to generate the scraping code using an LLM providing some prompts to parse through the required information from the files and transform into a standard Pandas dataframe (which can then be used for data analysis). Just wanted to check if anyone has explored this use case and has marginal or satisfactory success with the same (measured with respect to the time it takes between manual code (assuming one thoroughly understand the standard scraping libraries but still has to custom write some code for the unique schema/ask for a particular use case) versus prompting/iterating/testing through the LLM generated code)?

    "text": "Hi , With regards to this PYQ set, Dataset 1 Question 5 Find the organization (as identified by the `orgname` tag) that has applied for the most patents? If more than one organization have filed same number of patents, write them in alphabetically increasing order with comma separation. (Please do not put space between commas) If you check the answersheet, “NA” has been mentioned as the answer for Question 5 for majority of the datasets. However, NA (Not Applicable) is not an organization name. I understand that this answersheet may not have the ‘final’ final answers (post discussions/feedback from students who took the previous term exams), however, how does one make a decision on whether to skip (or include) missing tags/data when not explicitly stated in the question so because one can argue either ways that ‘NA’ is (or isn’t) the answer for Question 5 (as an example) - so in this case missing data should have been included in the calculations. So will such clarifications be addressed via: Case 1: the discourse thread for the ROE (assuming there will be one thread for the ROE), or Case 2: One can assume if the answer one has calculated and inputted in the textbox and verifies through the “Check” button - if that says, it is correct (for example, NAs and ‘nan’ are answers in the answerset shared for this PYQ), then that is, in fact, the final answer. Please review and advise. Question 5 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA Philip Morris Products S.A. NA NA NA NA NA SOCIETE DES PRODUITS NESTLE S.A. NA",

On my end, I’ve ensured that: The embeddings api invocation matches the approach shown in the colab notebook shared in the Week 5 “LLM Topic modeling” lecture. Checked the case of the word and ensured there are no leading or trailing spaces The length of the returned embeddings array matches the one specified in the question (e.g. 1536 as in the screenprint) Saved the embeddings in a csv and (as an additional check) verified the number of values greater than the specified number matches the one calculated in the code. So, it appears that the answerset (or answersets) may have a “off-by-one” error (in case this is a repeat of a previous term question, if there are any changes made in the internals of the embeddings api on OpenAI’s end and the embeddings returned (in the previous terms and now) just differ by a tiny little bit (pair-by-pair), but then, I am just speculating and very well could be wrong). Will debug further in case you confirm that the answer does lie in the options list (as specified in the question).

The method to find the closest answer is to find the absolute difference between the option and your calculation. That choice will be the correct one.

I checked my dataset and could see that Javascript had ~5k records and language=blank had ~3k. So in my case got the right answer without thinking of this edge scenario (just a pandas value counts check). If it had been the other way round (e.g. more blanks than javascript in the language column), I don’t know how to solve this except perhaps inputting blank as the answer and see if that works. Even if blank had been accepted as an answer in the portal, not sure if the backend verifier (if there are additional, fine grained validations that happen there) would have accepted blank as the answer though.",

However, due to a technical issue, it seems the form did not recognize my GitHub link, and as a result, all my answers have been marked as incorrect. After contacting the IITM Support Team via email, they suggested I bring this matter to the Discourse forum so that the instructors can review it directly. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could look into this issue and advise on how to resolve it. Thank you very much for your time and assistance.

The correct answer might be wrong if it is NaN but a wrong answer is definitely wrong.

In other words, if your dataset is wrong, its because of human error. The goals of this exercise is to understand the responsibility of extracting, cleaning, transforming, and producing the right results. Any failure in the early part of the chain will lead to erroneous results at the end. So saying that its “not my fault that my results are wrong because i have the wrong dataset,” is not understanding your responsibility to the first stages of the process.

I just want to point at fact that portal is misleading students by explicitly marking NaN as Correct! I am afraid this might be final marking. Please ensure that’s not the case.

    "text": "Thanks , here is my thought process on the same, In the context of year this is a subjective interpretation, so when we say users joined after 2020 it can also mean users joined after (year) 2020 “has set in”. This is used frequently in English for time units which has the potential to continue for some time like season, quarter, month etc. Just to give you an example, a simple google search of “Indian cricketers born after 1988” includes cricketers who are born in 1988. Now I understand Google is not the truth provenance for this, but this is just to illustrate that this interpretation also exists. {3D684798-96C5-4D1F-B785-345E9A6C1AA0} 1661×755 131 KB So in the context of this question, I would not say the script is totally wrong, but at the same time the OP of this topic is also not wrong in his interpretation. And thus I asked for your opinion\\clarification on the question that does it mean users joined Github starting 2020 or starting 2021? because I would not want to risk my 1 mark because of ambiguity of English language and would rather go with the intent of the question that people of the other side of the desk have set it with. I hope that clarifies what I wanted to ask. In my honest opinion, there is no black and white answer to this topic, so I would go with the logic the script is implemented with, believing that it was the original intent of the question.

    "text": "Dear .anand sir, I got QUIZ ID: Beijing:500 . I found several ambiguities while submitting answers. Q3. What are the 3 most popular license among these users? Ignore missing licenses. List the `license_name` in order, comma-separated. In Q3, based on my scraped data, I got: `NaN mit apache-2.0 others gpl-3.0` as top 5 most popular license. As it’s written in the question Ignore missing licenses , so I am left with `mit,apache-2.0,others` combination. But, if I am submitting this, it’s showing incorrect and `null,mit,apache-2.0` are being considered correct. image 752×182 16.6 KB Q6. Which programming language is the second most popular among users who joined after 2020? It is asking for second most popular language, but it’s accepting the first popular language. I am getting following as output for languages with their count (popularity) for users who joined after 2020: `language Python 10 NaN 9 HTML 6 TypeScript 5 C++ 3 JavaScript 3 Jupyter Notebook 3 Astro 2 Vue 2 C# 2 Name: count, dtype: int64` It should accept HTML, but it’s accepting Python. image 739×182 13.4 KB Q12. Do hireable users follow more people than those who are not hireable?

I have also tried the correlation of length of their bio in unicode characters and followers. none are working. 15. again, like the question said, for hireable=TRUE i’m obtaining the fraction of users with email an then from it, subtracting fraction of users with email where hireable is not TRUE. these were mostly done on excel.

If you find that there is more than one surname with an equal number of count(i.e. tie), provide them all, separating each by a comma. For e.g. if you have 2 most popular surnames, you can provide - surname1,surname2.

Here are the steps I did to identify the most common surname:- I first filter for rows where the `name` field is not null. Then, I extract the surname from each name by taking the last word. Next, I count the occurrences of each surname, find the maximum count, and filter surnames that match this maximum. Finally, I sorted the resulting list. Where am I going wrong? What am I missing? Even a small hint would be appreciated.",

There could be something incorrect in the way you’ve formed your query string. (b) If the above is not the reason and you believe you formed the query string right, print the query string in your program and paste that on the browser and see if you can debug more. (c) You may have to enable specific fine grained access to the github token. But this does not appear to be the reason since you mentioned the token for module 5 (which is not the same as the github personal acces token which you need to generate yourself from your github account )",

    "text": "Thank you Carlton for raising the query for extension w/operations. Just so it serves as a future reference, I think it is pertinent for ops to maintain consistency in policies. Here are the relevant points: Point#1 I believe operations drafted the student’s handbook and it very unambiguosly states for assignment submission dates: Date has been changed keeping in mind quiz on Oct 27 and Diwali on Oct 31 The above statement shows clear flexibilty (the way it should be) that allows some breathing space keeping in mind quiz 1, travel and a prominent festival date (all sandwitched between the T and T+10 dates). This project is an assignment so why isn’t that policy relevant in the context of TDS P1? That’s the first question. Point# 2 Like I mentioned before, why is a major project submission date coinciding with a prominent festival? It should not be a mechanical “Since P1 was published on T=21st Oct, lets just add T+10 to it and derive submission date as 31st Oct”. Well, 31st Oct happens to be Diwali - why wasn’t that considered.? “Providing ample time” argument, I feel, is besides the point. I started P1 post Quiz 1 and have personally finished the scraper and the calculations in under 5 hours total multi tasking with other stuff (for no other reason but for the fact that I’ve some prior experience). Rather, what I question is purely from the standpoint of point#1 and point#2 (e.g. adherence to stated policy standpoint) rather than whether the task is doable. I feel planning should have more nuance to it than merely adding a constant and deriving at an end date. A couple of days extra is all there was to it. Wouldn’t you agree? Best regards, Bahni",

    "text": "Here’s the thing. Once you have the code in place and have received the API response in CSV format, you upload those CSVs to GitHub and start answering the questions. When you reach questions 11, 12, 13, and 15, you start wondering where things are going wrong. After reviewing all the hints, I realized that the code checking your answer treats “true” and “false” as strings. If you check the file uploaded on GitHub and look at the raw version, you’ll see that it has everything stored as either TRUE/FALSE or True/False. Opening the file on your machine doesn’t help, because Excel automatically interprets these values as booleans. Here’s what I did—not the best method, and I’m sure someone could code a solution, but I did the best I could. I copied the raw file content from GitHub and pasted it into a Word document. I replaced all instances of FALSE with false and TRUE with true, then copied that back into the GitHub raw file and committed the changes. Once done, return to the project page and enter the same answers you initially got through your code or manual calculations, and you’ll see things align. I know this isn’t the most elegant solution, and I should handle it programmatically, but sometimes you have to implement fixes that work rather than seeking the most elegant solution.

    "text": "Thank you Carlton. Couple of follow up questions though. Right above the timelines in the course dashboard, it mentions the Sep 2024 grading document as the document containing the latest official information. Do the timelines specified on the course dashboard (screenshot above) overrides all timelines mentioned in the Sep 2024 grading documentation for TDS? If that is the case, I would suggest that the grading document be synced up with these updates so the information stays consistent at all locations. The submission timeline for Project 1 (P1) has been specified as Nov 10, 2024 in the grading document, however, on the course dashboard the project submission date is mentioned as 28th Oct, 2024 (a mismatch of close to 2 weeks). Which one is the correct submission date for P1? In case it is 28th Oct, 2024 (as mentioned in the course dashboard), it will be a rather demanding timeline (specifically for students who have in center Quiz 1 for 3 subjects on 27th Oct) and the project submission date happens to be the very next day. Add to that the fact that some candidates need to travel (intra-city) to and from the test centre. Please review and advise on the dates mismatch (for all projects and exams for TDS). Thanks.",

    "text": "Thank you Carlton. I refered to the grading document and see that the grading document is in sync now. Can the course admin team take a look at point # 2 I mentioned above and respond? I noticed that the projects 1 and 2 have a timeframe of 10 days per project. Project # 1 has a release date of today (it has not been released until noon, I presume the project will be released later in the day). So, I am not sure what is the complexity level of project # 1. However, I raised the point of Quiz 1 because: (a) There will be students who will be appearing in as many as 3 subjects in Quiz 1 (in the case they have TDS as their 4th subject), and (b) There will be students who will be travelling intra city to appear for Quiz 1 (so in order to accomodate candidates who fall in this category, at the least, 26th, 27th and 28th Oct. should not even be considered as days which will be available to them to work on the project). With that said, can the course admin team review the submission date for project 1 and provide flexibility considering overlap of Quiz 1 (e.g. preparations, mock tests (mock tests are typically solved by many in the week prior to the quiz) and the logistics involved on the part of the candidate, for example, intra-city travel (for many))?",

    "text": "Just a bit of feedback to the course admin team because I do see there is a need for better planning around the timelines and offering flexibility when there are genuine reasons to do so. Consider these points: I mentioned in point (b) above that if the plan is to provide 10 days to work on projects 1 and 2 (publish till submission) that has a weightage of 20% overall, then I raised a pertinent point that 26th, 27th and 28th October should be excluded from the planning because there are students who travel inter city and we do spend a greater part of the two days pre and prior to the quiz date traveling to and from the test city. I did not receive any response on why that rationale (e.g. the case of students who travel inter city for the offline exams) should not be factored into in your planning. So effectively, for some, the days available for project 1 reduces to 7-8 (give or take). Week 4 GA assignment end date was scheduled just 1.5 days prior to Quiz 1 (and there are students who take up as many as 4 subjects per term and have to work on mock tests before appearing for the offline Quizzes) The submission date for Project 1 coincides with the date of a prominent national festival! If I may quote from the student’s handbook , there is a clear policy of offering flexibility around such key events (excerpt below): * Date has been changed keeping in mind quiz on Oct 27 and Diwali on Oct 31 If weekly assignment submission date (which in most cases have a weightage of just 1%) can be adjusted keeping in mind key events, then a project that carries a weightage of 20% overall should have offered a few day’s additional flexibility in line with the stated policies in the Student’s handbook.",

So pls do analyse your data to see if it warrants any detailed maneuvering For the purpose of assignment, I will only remove the leading @ , and validate my Q4 answer by clicking “Check answers” button As an exercise in learning, you may parse all and identify the top one [ BTW, Q16 explores that with a slightly different ask] Do you think this is a good candidate for your Readme.md?",

Other questions such as Q12, Q13, and Q15 have a similar problem, i.e. I have tried various techniques with different logic but still shows incorrect response.

I was sure the no of users in Mumbai are not that low, so after some investigation and asking chatgpt about it I understand there is a rate limit set by github to avoid overburdening their servers. One solution to this is creating a personal access token which increases your rate limit from ~60 to ~5000 per hour. But i have checked and there are around ~55,000 users (in Mumbai). Are we supposed to fetch 5000 records per hour for 11 hours; which does not seem like the way to go, or is there some other way to handle this rate limit. Please advice.",

If we feel there is value in the partial recording then we will release it, but for the moment, i think most of it will get subsumed into what will be explained by tomorrows session. We also usually add more sessions as it warrants if we percieve that more time is needed to cover some of the topics. Week 1 has been largely self explanatory with regards to getting familiar with the tools. There was a small section in the previous recording that i might still release, which showcased how to get started with vscode, setting up a virtual environment and some useful extensions. (But if you are already familiar with that and had no trouble with week 0 then the recording is of little value to you). Kind regards",

Can we instead launch the video(s) in separate window(s) so we do not loose the “parent” page? Thanks.",

But if the link is set to open in a new tab, there’s no way around that. Also, users expect clicking to continue in the same window by default. Browser Behavior and Navigation : Most modern browsers preserve the page scroll location when you press the back button. Also, new windows can disrupt the flow of the back button and make navigation less intuitive. Accessibility : Screen readers don’t do so well with new windows. It may not be immediately apparent that a new window has opened, leading to confusion. A good workaround for these is TamperMonkey . You can write your own scripts that automatically load video links from TDS in a new window.",

Have you followed the instructions carefully or looked at the sample notebook which was provided in the Week 4 content that accesses the same repository to see how one might access the database? `import pandas as pd import sqlalchemy as sa engine = sa.create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://guest:relational.relational-data.org/stats\")` Note: This code snippet was taken from the same sample notebook provided in Week 4. It will not work if you copy paste it. You have to change it to suit what your question is asking. IMPORTANT: When debugging your code make sure you are not hitting the public endpoint again and again. That’s a sure fire way to get banned from accessing it. Connect ONCE using the right connection details. Get the required data ONCE and store it either in a variable (or on disk - which is preferred because then even if your code crashes you can retrieve the data locally). Then do the debugging of the rest of your code ad nauseum. Jupyter Notebooks are very useful in this regard for separating out code cells and doing the debugging separately from your data connection/fetch cells. Regards",

You can also use a multitude of different methodologies/algorithms within open refine to catch all the various edge cases and quickly tweak parameters of those algorithms in a nice gui.

If I may be completely candid, it looks like an answer spat out by GPT. For example there is a meaningless operation `match = pattern.match (line)` Why? what’s wrong with just `line` ? (assuming logs are an array of lines) Did you try to examine the output of a few samples of each match to see if you are actually getting the expected output at each stage of the regex? It might be that your regex is not performing as expected and filtering out the wrong lines. Regex is a tough and unforgiving tool to debug. I will show how to solve this in the live TA session, and I will show a much simpler method that is humanly easily verifiable. From the movie Maverick Topgun… The end is inevitable, Maverick. Your kind is headed for extinction. jjaevdoscwpb1 2034×1203 322 KB Someday GPT will relegate such skills obsolete… But until that day… Yours truly, TDS TA PS: Moral of the story is its okay to use GPT. In fact we encourage it (it is the future), but please try to do some basic debugging and checks first. Use GPT in a progressive step wise fashion so that you can verifiably solve the problem. I am here to guide you on your TDS journey. I will not be able to debug GPT’s code all the time because, lets face it. GPT knows a lot more than me. It just does not have “brains”. So sometimes you need to think about what is actually happening instead of completely treating it as a magic black box. Cheers!",

Also typically if you are getting several questions wrong, then its far more likely that the logic you have employed has errors. I have looked at your code and presumed that it is /hindimp3/ and Tuesday. I do get the correct answer in the range you provided. Also if you wanted help with code, it is not practical to debug your code when you share screen shots. It is far more kinder (indeed almost a prerequisite for code that is more than a couple of lines) to those who might help you to actually encapsulate your code in block quotes. A good example of how to ask help, is like how this fellow student has demonstrated: Doubt GA-1 Tools in Data Science `Quiz id: e23cf3e74cea4b56a217372fafc75228 In Q-3, Every time I am getting different when I hit the link for collab notebook to fix the code and get back to the page light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.246) this value '0.246' is changing every time that means window is reloading every time so I am sure answers of my last two question would be change also then what to do in that case import numpy as np from PIL import Image from google.colab import files import colorsys # There is a mistake in…` You are likely to get much more help if you do so.

    "text": "Here is an OPTIONAL project: Record a 10-minute video in which you create an application entirely using LLMs and deploy it. Any app is fine . Any language. Simple or complex. Business or gaming. Anything is fine. Your choice. Create the app only using LLMs . You can use an LLM (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini, Cursor, Cody, etc.) but you can only prompt the app to write code. You can copy-paste code and run code don’t write or edit even a single line of code directly. Use LLMs to debug and edit. Code completion is NOT allowed – only prompting/chatting. Record the entire process in 10 min . Don’t edit, trim, enhance, or annotate the video. You should record yourself creating the entire app from start to finish. Practice beforehand if you like. Record in 1 take. Share the video and app . Publish the video publicly anywhere (e.g. YouTube and share the link.) Publish the app publicly anywhere (e.g. GitHub pages, Glitch.me , Heroku, etc.) or upload a ZIP file with the code (for slightly lower marks.) Submit via a reply to this thread. Multiple submissions per person are fine. Work in groups if you like but only the submitter gets marks. I will award up to 1 bonus mark at my discretion based on: How well you prompt the LLM How impressive the app is (if you’ve hosted it - I probably won’t run your code) How closely you followed the rules above This exercise is to help you (and me) learn a topic that’ll probably change the way we all code: using LLMs to code.

    "text": "– yes, that can happen. This is a good opportunity to talk about two-way doors. Jeff Bezos wrote : `Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groupsAs organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency` GA1 is a good example of a 2-way door. Try an approach. If the answer is incorrect, try another. You get instant feedback. No need to check. Here’s what I suggest. Go ahead and let the newer file replace the older one. If the answer’s incorrect, try it the other way around. One or the other will work if you have the rest of the steps right. But to your question, yes, duplicate files CAN occur.",

    "text": "Windows files system is case insensitive. Linux typically uses a case sensitive filesystem (although you can configure it to whatever you wanted). Typically a VM is completely isolated, however because WSL still has to be accessible to the windows filesystem (you can for example view the WSL filesystem directly from windows file explorer), it seems to have been configured with a case insensitive filesystem. This is odd in your case because Windows documentation seems to suggest the default is otherwise. Case Sensitivity | Microsoft Learn Google Colab notebooks has a linux backend and currently runs on Ubuntu 22.04 You can run these in your google colab to see what it runs `!cat /etc/*release` This is the file system info `!df -Th` Incredibly on ext4 (which typically what most default linux systems use), you are even able to enable case insensitivity on a directory by directory basis! (for those power users that have very specific use cases). Windows also claims to now support this feature on NT through the use of directory flags. Nice bit of work. Kind regards",

    "text": "Namaskaram, I have taken TDS this term after MLF and MLT. I am moderately comfortable with Python (although I haven’t done it, I’m fairly confident I can get at least a B in PDSA if I do it now; using specific libraries is an entirely different question). Regarding Excel, most things used in BDM should be fine for me. Now comes the HTML and JavaScript part. I can read and understand some pure HTML code and make static pages without any bells and whistles—which more or less amounts to nothing, as it will just look like an average LaTeX document. I know nothing about Java or JavaScript. Now, dropping the course is not really a good option for me due to some personal reasons. Hence, I’m thinking of just learning what’s needed on the go. I am sure there will be others in a similar situation too. Things being what they are (I didn’t know about these prerequisites early enough, so I didn’t prepare during the three-week gap after the last term exams), can you please suggest some references—documents, books, articles, sites, or YouTube playlists—for getting started in the best possible way? It would have been nice if such content were curated and added as Week 0—MLF has a Week 0 where they list out some topics from statistics and mathematics. It would be helpful if the resources are divided into categories like: Minimal to get going, and can learn more as needed All that we need If it can also be structured like these concepts would be used in week n; knowing this concept will provide better insights, it would be great. TL;DR Please provide some structured resources for the prerequisites, such as articles, documents, books, or YouTube playlists. Thanks for any help and your time.",

Reviews that are outliers are rejected. Bonus Marks are only on Discourse. Answers must be submitted according to the Discourse post. Discretion of Bonus Marks are upto how impressed the Prof is with your submission. Bonus Marks are really worth it. In total they are worth half of the total GAs. Also Bonus Marks are great fun! ROE Mocks are just previous ROEs. There is no pattern for ROEs. They are never the same as previous ROEs. However core skills of ROEs remain the same: Scraping webpages. HTML, CSS, Javascript (particularly for selecting dom elements), sessions, cookies. Scrapping PDFs. Python Tabula library. Python (especially Pandas) Nominatim SQL and maybe some other minor tools. ROE week content: Week 2 to 4 ROE is open book (not proctored, use anything you wish including GPT) ROE is very, very hard. Start preparing now. SCT is NOT required for ROE. Week 5: you will get some $ allowance for LLM tokens. Awesome. And super fun topic. Optional Videos in week 2 are NOT optional. They are a necessary for ROE (and end term). Bonus 1: Making LLM app: Just sharing the code on Github is not an app. `Github` and `Github Pages` are NOT the same thing. Github Pages is a web server where you can deploy your app. Github repo is just a place to store and share your code. An app is a working application that anyone with web access can use just by clicking on the link you provide. Your app has to be submitted in the Discourse post where the Bonus post was made. Subscribe to Discourse emails for TDS. That way you will not miss important information like the Bonus questions. Listen to Podcast - very informational about current data science industry. BASH - there is a great book for this from System Commands. accounts.google.com Google Drive: Sign-in Access Google Drive with a Google account (for personal use) or Google Workspace account (for business use). The links at the bottom and top of videos in the modules are very valuable. Week 1 Video session is available on the TDS You Tube Video Playlist. Access will NOT be given to the video links in the calendar. The ONLY place to get access to the videos will be the TDS You Tube Video Channel . Kind regards, TDS TA",

If you do a lot of manual solving, then yes it will be very tedious and you have not gained the learning that is expected. Bottom line: Do the GA1 in one go. This feature is being tested only for the GA1 (and GA0). The remaining GAs will be normal like you are used to in the seek portal. For next term the goal is to roll this out for most if not all the GAs (in TDS at least) by learning what to improve and what achieves the best learning outcome. Regards",

The reason behind this suggestion is my experience with one of the questions where till the end I could not figure what was wrong. After sir mentioned the locale sort and it was rectified later for all, I realized what was going wrong. I spent nearly an hour on it trying to check everything but finally gave up. Again, there is a learning in frustration but sometimes, people (like me) will give up after getting 9/10 and not do the whole thing again just for a 10/10.",

Is small `d` before capital `G` ? It depends on how the UNIX sort command operates. If the locale (e.g. via the environment variable `LC_ALL` ) is set to `C` , it sorts like programmers expect — uppercase before lowercase. If it’s set to something else, e.g. `en_GB.UTF` , it would sort like the British do. I missed anticipating that others’ systems would have different locale settings. Now, I’ve changed the question now to explicitly set `LC_ALL=C` to get consistent sorting. Thanks for flagging this!",

Use `mv` to move all files under folders into an empty folder. Then rename all files replacing numbers with zeros (i.e. `a12b.txt` becomes `a00b.txt` ). What’s the result of running `grep . * | sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder? Moved all files to a new directory. (in new directory) `for file in *[0-9]*; do mv \"$file\" \"$(echo \"$file\" | sed 's/[0-9]/0/g')\" done` (in new directory) `grep . * | sort | sha256sum` output : 375c68d396f957cd004cf8ec1d7b83ea2f193ee6e4bea770d299131a6ff82b30 I followed the above steps, I can visually see the expected output, yet hash value is incorrect. sir can you find what i’m missing out in the process?",

It is listed as a pre-requisite in the course introduction section. I find it frustrating that these aren’t taught in any courses of the diploma program and neither does the general description of the course (here: Course Page - IIT Madras Diploma Program ) state knowing javascript and html is a pre-requsite. It simply says Machine Learning Foundations is a co-requisite. I have cleared Math-2, Stat-2, MLF and BDM. Do I need to rethink taking up this course? Do I first need to learn javascript and html from elsewhere and then take this course? Please clarify. Thank you.",

Generally if you are struggling with these basics (because that is what they are), then you will have to put extra effort in order to get up to speed. TDS covers a lot of ground in terms of the tools used for Data Science. Past experience shows us that students who are not comfortable with the basics find the Remote Online Exam very challenging and many score 0. So the GA0 gives you a chance to assess if you want to “bite the bullet” and take the course or do you want to give yourself some time to become familiar with the basic requirements. We do this early so that you can still avail the drop window, if you find the the course challenging. We (the TDS team) have lobbied hard to actually have some concrete (programming) pre-requisites for this course, but the BS management (not the TDS team) has countered with, this is not possible because some students only do the Data Science Diploma. I totally agree that these requirements must be made known prior to taking this course. However due to an impasse on how to structure the diploma, to better deal with this issue, it is what it is. I know this is not of much comfort. Having said that, you also have one of the best professors and I dare say with the backing of data (some of the best TAs) in the program who are here to help you succeed. But it will require much effort compared to most other subjects. Students who have been through TDS can mostly vouch for one thing. Its one of the most interesting, practical and useful course in making you job ready. But it is a trial by fire. However if you have done the diploma in programming, its fairly easy (which is why we always recommend taking it towards the end of the diploma). Hope that helps. Kind regards",

But it all feels haphazard since I have no familiarity with the html/js. Even the python libraries being used are unfamiliar. I MAY pull through the course but it is my feeling that it will be far from satisfactory for me since I like to learn things in a structured manner. You have said doing diploma in programming will help understand this course much better. I cannot do the entire diploma, but can you suggest some courses from the programming diploma which I may look through in this term and take this course up in the next term? And/or, can you suggest any other source from where I can learn given my background and requirements of this course? I am thankful your response.",

Dear Students, Amit and myself, were your TDS TAs for May-24 term. We know that everything did not go smoothly as we hoped. In a few days, we will have a meeting with the course instructors and the professor so we need your feedback to show them the right picture about this course. This feedback form is completely anonymous. We are NOT asking for your email, roll no. or name. Your email-id is NOT recorded . You can also open this form using the incognito tab if you want. So please give us your honest opinion. Changes for this term was the result of honest feedback : Anand sir changed most GAs to make them more practical and allow you to apply and practise what you learnt. Anand sir held weekly catch-up meetings with the TAs to keep up to date with the latest issues, which in turn allowed us (TAs) to respond in a timely manner to queries and problems that were raised by students through the week. Anand sir was visibly involved with discourse, and had significant input in the creation of the Projects. He also gave students great bonus questions and gave valuable direct feedback to students. Anand sir introduced new and relevant course content (LLMs) and removed outdated materials. This is still an ongoing process which reflects AIs growing importance to all spheres of life. There are 3 sections to fill: Content Feedback Operational Feedback Final Thoughts Thank you for taking the time to help make TDS the best subject in the Diploma. Your TDS TAs, Amit and Carlton",

    "text": "Network analysis is used in climate modeling to study complex interactions and relationships within the climate system. It allows researchers to understand how different components of the climate system (e.g., temperature, precipitation, atmospheric circulation) are interconnected. Here are some ways network analysis is applied in climate modeling: Spatio-temporal network analysis for studying climate patterns | Climate Dynamics (2014) ENSO in CMIP5 simulations: network connectivity from the recent past to the twenty-third century | Climate Dynamics (2014) Climate Networks: Climate data (such as temperature or pressure) from different geographical locations can be represented as a network. In this network, nodes represent locations, and edges represent correlations or interactions between climate variables at these locations. This approach helps in identifying key regions that influence global climate patterns. Networks of climate change: connecting causes and consequences | Applied Network Science | Full Text Teleconnections: Network analysis is used to study teleconnections, which are long-distance relationships between climate variables (like the El Niño Southern Oscillation or the North Atlantic Oscillation). By analyzing these networks, researchers can detect how changes in one part of the world affect other regions. Extreme Event Prediction: Networks help in identifying how extreme weather events, like heat waves or storms, propagate through the system. By mapping these events in a network, it becomes easier to predict areas at risk or potential future events based on past occurrences. Climate network analysis helps pinpoint regions at higher risk of extreme weather | ScienceDaily Feedback Loops: Network analysis is useful for identifying feedback loops in the climate system, where changes in one variable influence another, which in turn feeds back into the original variable. For example, melting ice reduces the Earth’s albedo, leading to more warming, which further accelerates ice melt. etc. etc. etc. If you still feel Climate modeling is a “niche” application of network analysis, you can ask the instructors for second consideration.

People in the statistics department (and the business department) take particular umbrage to the improper use of graphs. It’s one of their pet peeves. A good analogy is that we can use a spanner to hit a nail. Does not mean its the best tool to hit a nail.

The very humble and supportive CREATIVE trio of Anand Sir, Sir, and Sir guided us throughout. Whether it was the ROE (which makes me wish for it in place of oppe exams) or the Mission Mars 1-mark optional projects, it was more than I could have asked for when registering for the TDS course. One thing I feel I missed to fully experience the essence of TDS was the weekly Wednesday sessions by Dibu John Sir, as I only watched the recorded sessions on YouTube. When certain modules towards the end of the course had previous term recordings where Dibu Sir interacted with students, I felt I missed something valuable. All the course content provided significant value, thanks to the TDS team . Not just the official team, but the student community in TDS this term was also a delight, especially the efforts of in supporting us through the difficulties we faced.",

    "text": "Thank you for tagging me. My overall experience was kind of nice. Initially, Week 1 felt very easy but as the weeks progressed, I felt there were so many tools to learn and handle data differently. This is one of the courses where I didn’t make any handwritten notes which I usually have done for all the courses expect English (mostly done with both diplomas). The bonus assignments quite interesting & good for practicing practical skills although I couldn’t do all due to busy schedule and health issues. I did visit discourse from time to time hoping to find more extra activity but later started helping peers & posting my doubts here. As for ROE 1 didn’t feel it that was difficult but had I not have gotten confused with that timing issue (slowed my paced a little thinking it was an hour) I would have done 2 more questions right. It was good though. The projects helped me put my skills to test which ROE didn’t. I used ChatGPT and it worked out so I gave that ROE marks credit to that GPT LLM. At the very last, I was unsure how to prepare for End term but my peers helped me and will post my digital notes (that’s what I prepared a week ago) after polishing a bit for next term students. .anand sir’s guidance & teachings helped a lot in building these skills and both the TAs were there to help us (can’t thank enough). used ChatGPT fine-tuned for TDS to generate 300+ questions which were really helpful for end term a big thanks to him. End term was a breeze completed within 10-15 minutes with hardly 1-2 questions wrong (mistakes checked with answer key - some courses have released that) Overall, it was a nice experience with some hiccups like issues in GAs & projects but that’s part & parcel of life (nothing is perfect). I hope I will be able to put these skills to good use in real life. Wishing the best for everyone here… Thanks & Regards, Swati Jain",

As a person coming from a zero programming background, I had to endure the various pain points associated with the course (i am talking about myself) specifically in fetching and scrapping data. I slowly started gaining confidence after watching the videos and TA session recordings multiple times. But that confidence was only short lived as I was completely overrun by the ROE juggernaut. I thought ROE is a real out of the box masterclass . It prepares one to handle real world decision making situations in a better way (utilizing limited resources in a optimal manner). I would say the course was very well designed and structured capturing all the widely used DS tools. It is also heartening to see the course contents being regularly updated to remain in sync with the rapidly changing tools and technologies used in data science. At the end of it, it is only postive takeaways for me from this course. Specifically: Exposure to various tools used in present day DS industry. Kindling interest to delve deeper in to these tools. Giving a birds eye view of the meaningful usage of data and kniiting interesting narratives from it. Professor @ s.anand made the course all the more intersting and lively. Special thanks to him for sharing his rich corporate experience with the students. My TDS experience will not be complete without according special mention to and for their commitment and handholding throughout the term. I feel this course should find a much higher spot than a mere 3 credit course in the whole BS degree programme. Best regards, Rajesh Ramakrishnan",

This course, whether be the projects or the graded assignments or ROE, pushed us to work on real life applications of tools used in data science. Thank you .anand sir for designing this course in such a beautiful way covering so many important aspects. Also thanks to and for their sessions, and all support they gave to us students.",

    "text": "Hey there! Hope you’re having a wonderful day. I am reaching out to you with a rather strange request regarding project 2. Despite completing my project without much issues, a submission error (I was unaware of) occurred, and my csv file did not get submitted as I expected. And I just noticed this error (today, literally now) as I’ve been busy with end term prep. Now that I’ve explained my bit, my request is that would it be possible to go through my project to just evaluate my work and provide feedback? Since grading ended on the 25th, I know providing grading would be next to impossible. But just to understand my errors and rectify it in the future would one of the TA’s or instructors be able to help me figure out errors in my project 2? I would really appreciate it if I was granted with such an opportunity. I just want to understand my errors before moving onto my upcoming courses. Do let me know if this would be possible. If its a positive response, I don’t mind sharing my questions and answers here.",

I would like to request one final extra activity question now that everyone has completed their coursework. These activities have been instrumental in helping us gain real-world skills and were enjoyable to complete, so I’m hoping for one last challenge. Thanks & Regards, Swati Jain",

In the remaining time i also attempted MLF (I had that in FN session) and realised that AN version was much easier, then I completed Python and English 1 paper too (and had 10 minutes remaining). It’s crazy when you realise that the same paper that took me 3 hours to finish when i was in foundation level (Python and English) took me just about 45 minutes now. I dont know if the afternoon sessions exams are actually easy or if i just felt that way. But tbh i dont really know what else they could ask in the end term for TDS since this course is more about knowing the tools than the actual syntax and stuff. Either way i just hope that the project scores are not a disappointment and that they change their minds and do relative grading for the ROE. The experience in this course was great with loads of practical learning. Thanks for that to the team.",
